# Customer-Service

These scripts have helped the Customer-Service Department save a lot of time. In the normal manner, the CS team was supposed manually compare every month the information from our system with the information within the files received from the central server located in Bracknell/UK, both for Avis and Budget brands. To keep it short, the script was highlighting if a chargeback send by Romania to a different country was processed or not and also retrieved info regarding chargebacks received by Romania from another country.
